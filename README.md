# CMake tutorial from zero to intermediate

> This is a tutorial for myself as well as my students to have a basic understanding of how to use build system to automatically manage our projects in an efficent way

## How to learn

I write these commit by commit, from a simple single file program with no build system to a multiple files program with build system, and then a more step forward to a multiple files program with build system and thirdparty libraries.
So I think the best way to learn is following the git commit. I've try my best to keep each commit message as clear and precise as possible.
